## About Me

I am currently a Graduate Student Researcher at the UC Berkeley Institute of Urban and Regional Development working on real-time air quality mapping in the Bay Area. I hold a Master of Landscape Architecture from UC Berkeley with a concentration in <span style="color:#a3e2ff">environmental planning</span> and <span style="color:#a3e2ff">geospatial science</span>. My interests lie at the intersection of scientific research and planning, where I strive to leverage <span style="color:#a3e2ff">model-centric</span> and <span style="color:#a3e2ff">community-based</span> approaches to bridge knowledge gaps and drive meaningful policy changes.

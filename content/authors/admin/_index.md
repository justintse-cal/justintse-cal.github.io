## About Me

I am currently a Graduate Student Researcher at the UC Berkeley Institute of Urban and Regional Revelopment working on real-time air quality mapping in the Bay Area. I hold a Master of Landscacpe Architecture from UC Berkeley with a concentration in environmental planning and geospatial science. My interests lie at the intersection of scientific research and planning, where I strive to leverage model-centric and community-based approaches to bridge knowledge gaps and drive meaningful policy changes.

abstract: This project was motivated by recent scholarship and policy interest in advancing “digital twins” for cities, in which a real-time model of dynamics in an urban region can be used for decision making purposes. We co-developed a real-time, hyperlocal AQI estimation tool with five community organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area that experience disproportionately high exposure to air pollution. The completed platform, named the Bay Area Community Air Quality Map (the BACAQ Map), utilizes PurpleAir PM2.5 data as the input to an automated interpolation that produces estimated PM2.5 values across the entire Bay Area on an hourly basis using EPA’s Nowcast Air Quality Index (AQI-PM2.5). The tool is designed for use by school decision makers (superintendents, principals, coaches, and parents) and summarizes data at both the school and school district level. The map tool also represents other drivers of air pollution as separate layers in the map, including wind direction and speed, air temperature and humidity, active wildfires, smoke plumes, and known sources of local emissions (businesses, truck routes, airports, and other public facilities).

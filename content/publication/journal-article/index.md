abstract: This study evaluates the performance of PurpleAir (PA) sensors for ambient temperature measurement by comparing their data with that from collocated high-precision temperature loggers across a dense urban network in a humid subtropical U.S. county. Although PA sensors show a moderate correlation with reference data (r = 0.86), they consistently overestimate temperatures by an average of 3.77 °C. This suggests that while PA sensors are useful for tracking temperature trends, they are not reliable for high-accuracy applications such as monitoring extreme heat events. To address this, we developed and assessed several regression-based calibration methods using readily available crowdsourced data. The most effective approach reduced root mean square error by 51% and mean absolute error by 47%. We further explored the application of uncalibrated PA data in detecting heat events. This work contributes to more accurate heat mapping and supports multi-hazard vulnerability assessments, ultimately advancing the development of climate-resilient cities.
